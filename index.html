      <p>Hello! This is a small project to map out various landmarks that represent 
        Cold War politics in India.</p>
      <p>Whenever we study about Cold War, we are mostly reminded of events unfolding 
        between US and USSR either in Europe, Cuba, Korea or Vietnam.</p>
      <p>Thus, this is an attempt to show how Cold War politics played out closer to home
        and how we were not just spectators but participants who were shaped by and also 
        shaped the Cold War.</p>
      <p>The map highlights statues, museums and memorials of important individuals that
        played a pivotal role. These sites tell a story and the hyperlinked articles will
        help you understand them.</p>
      <p>For now the map only focusses on Delhi but it will be expanded to cover different
        sites all over the country. (Although, it is interesting to see how even in Delhi
        the politics was concentrated  to 1 specific area.)</p>
      <p>In case you want to more, here are few interesting articles I found:</p>
      <p>1. <a href="https://archive.ph/mKvLG", target="_blank">
        How the Cold War in Germany played a small yet significant part in establishing IIT Madras</a></p>
      <p>2. <a href="https://archive.ph/WU7s0", target="_blank">
        The Surviving Soviet Heritage of Delhi</a></p>
